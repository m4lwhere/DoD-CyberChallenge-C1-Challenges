# Fuzzy Wuzzy
We have a website which we know has some pages on it with flags, we just don't know what the pages are. Can you find all the parts of the flags within this website?

NOTE: You will need to SSH into the container and then use the website hosted on TCP port 80. The flag is in four separate parts.
The credentials to ssh in are `ctfuser:ctfpassword`.
